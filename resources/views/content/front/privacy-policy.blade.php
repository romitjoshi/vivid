<p class=MsoNormal>Subject to applicable law, we share your information with
our affiliates, suppliers, vendors, and/or their agents and employees for a
business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose,
we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to
both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose
except performing the contract. As examples, we may share your personal
information or other data (A)&nbsp;with third parties assisting us in the
provision, administration, and management of goods and services generally;
(B)&nbsp;with third parties that assist us in providing goods and services that
you request; (C)&nbsp;with third parties that support our business operations
or provide marketing or advertising services on our behalf, including
marketing, technical, accounting, legal or other professionals; and (D)&nbsp;with
the IRS for tax accounting purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by
law or approved by you. We may use your information for our general business
operations and goods and services provided by us if it is in a form that is not
capable of being personally identified with you (including hashed email
addresses as described below or other persistent identifiers) or if it is
combined with information from one or more other customers in aggregate form
that does not personally identify any particular customer.&nbsp; We may also
sell, license or otherwise provide such de-identified or aggregated data to
third parties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and,
depending upon the transaction, your information may be one of the transferred
assets. In the event that Vivid Panel or any Site is acquired by another
company, your information may be part of the assets transferred to the
acquiring party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6. WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS TO CONTROL THE USE OF MY
INFORMATION?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
the rights provided below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Promotional Communications Opt-Out</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may email you with information about other products and
services of Vivid Panel, including information about selected third parties. If
you do not want to receive such promotional communications from Vivid Panel,
you may decline to receive those email messages by opting out when you receive
such a communication, sign-up, register, or from within your account, as
applicable. However, we may still communicate with you by email if such email
communication is for the purpose of corresponding with you regarding products
or services you have requested, related to protecting your interests, including
any information, property, or other data, or to provide you with any notification
or disclosure that may be required by applicable law or this Privacy Policy.
Accordingly, you agree that all communications, disclosures, and notices sent
to you by email satisfy any requirement that notice be provided in writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span>Location Sharing Opt-Out</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>You may opt-out of allowing

disabling permission for our Sites to access such location detection functionality

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability
Rights</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are a California resident, you may request that Vivid
Panel disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your
personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your
verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and
Deletion Rights), we will, to the extent required by applicable law, disclose
specific information about what information we have collected, the sources we
collected information from, our business purpose in collecting information, who
we shared information with, the specific pieces of information we collected
about you (also called a data portability request), and any sales or
disclosures for a business purpose of your information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Deletion Request Rights</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are a California resident, you may request that Vivid
Panel delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and
retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your
verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers
to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception
applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is
permitted under applicable law. You should also be aware that deleting certain
information may impact your ability to receive certain services from Vivid
Panel including newsletters, accounts, subscriptions, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion
Rights</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion
rights described above as permitted under state law, please submit a verifiable
consumer request to us by either:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;border:none'><p>Calling us at (475) 212 -5497</p></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><p>Emailing us at SUPPORT@VPCOMIX.COM</p></li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your
behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal
information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request
must: (A) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
authorized representative; and (B) describe your request with sufficient detail
that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Response Timing and Format</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request
within 45 days. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and
extension period in writing. If applicable, any disclosures we provide will
only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s
receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply
with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a
format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should
allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
hindrance.&nbsp; We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7. TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sites are based in the United States, and are directed
to U.S. residents, and we process and store information in the U.S. If you are
located outside the U.S., we and our service providers may transfer your
information to, or store or access to your information in, jurisdictions that
may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>8. CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to
children under the age of 13. Vivid Panel assumes products and services
purchased by credit card are purchased by adults. Vivid Panel respects the
privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<b>COPPA</b>”) and applicable state
law. On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Vivid Panel does not collect
personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age
of 16 except in those limited circumstances where Vivid Panel believes that
such collection is permitted under COPPA and other applicable law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted
personal information to Vivid Panel, he or she can contact us via email or
postal mail as listed below. Vivid Panel will promptly delete the information
upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>9. VIVID PANEL’S DATA SECURITY DISCLAIMER.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We do not provide any guarantee or warranty by us that your
information will not be accessed or compromised by third parties, or that we
will use all available security technologies to prevent unauthorized access to,
use, or disclosure of your personally identifying information; or that your
information will be transmitted without unauthorized interception or
modification.&nbsp; We may permanently delete or destroy any and all
information at any time as determined by us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10. EUROPEAN UNION / GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
(“GDPR”)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are located within the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”)
or within another jurisdiction having similar data protection laws to the GDPR,
Vivid Panel provides such users with the following rights:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

 <li class=MsoNormal><p>3. the right to object to the processing of your information
     (e.g., for direct marketing purposes);</p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>4. the right to have information you directly provided to us
     provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
     format;</p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>5. wherein the processing of your information is based on
     your consent, the right to withdraw that consent subject to legal or
     contractual restrictions;</p></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><p>7. the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory
     authority responsible for data protection matters.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we hold any information about you that is incorrect, or
if there are any changes to your details, please let us know so that we can
keep our records accurate and up-to-date. If you withdraw your consent to the
use of your information for purposes set out in our Privacy Policy, we may not
be able to provide you with access to all or parts of the Sites. We will retain
your information for the duration of our business relationship and afterward
for as long as is necessary and relevant for our legitimate business purposes,
in accordance with our data retention, marking and destruction policy, or as
otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Certain data protection laws require us to rely on one or
more lawful grounds to process your personal information. We consider the
following grounds to be relevant:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>1. Consent: Wherein you have provided consent in accordance
     with applicable law to us using your personal information in a certain
     way, such as to send you email, text, and/or telephone marketing.</p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>2. Performance of a contract: Wherein we are entering into a
     contract with you or performing our obligations under it, such as when you
     buy products and services through the Sites.</p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>3. Legal obligation: Where necessary so that we can comply
     with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject, for example
     where we are ordered by a court or regulatory authority.</p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><p>4. Legitimate interests: Wherein it is reasonably necessary
     to achieve our or others’ legitimate interests (as long as what the
     information is used for is fair and does not unduly impact your rights).
     We consider our legitimate interests to be operating the Sites and
     facilitating the services we provide to users. For example, to:</p></li>

consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative)
and your rights under data protection laws. We will not use your personal
information where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the nature and location of our business in the United
States, your personal data will be disclosed to Vivid Panel and others as
outlined herein outside of the EEA, including in the United States. It may also
be processed by our employees or suppliers operating outside the EEA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12. COOKIES, ADVERTISEMENTS AND THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sites may contain links to other websites. We are not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We may
allow third-party advertisers to place ads on the Sites. These third-party
advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to help present the
advertisements to you or to help measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements. Some advertisers may use cookies or other tracking technologies
to serve ads based on your visits to the Sites and other websites on the
Internet. The use of such technologies is subject to the privacy policies of
the third-party advertisers and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. As a
result, if you respond to any such third-party advertisers by clicking on the
advertisements and/or visiting their websites or the websites of any other
third party, be sure you evaluate their privacy policies before providing them
with any of your information. To opt out of a third party’s use of cookies, you
must visit such third party’s website and follow its specified opt-out
procedures. For example, we use Google Ad Manager (DoubleClick) product on our
Sites. You can learn more about Google, and how they use your data by
visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/"><span
style='color:#0563C1'>http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/</span></a>.
You may opt out of Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the
Google Advertising Policies and Principles page at&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/"><span style='color:#0563C1'>http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</span></a>.
You can also opt out of some, but not all, third-party advertiser cookies by
visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website, located at&nbsp;<a
href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/browser-opt-out/"><span style='color:#0563C1'>https://thenai.org/opt-out/browser-opt-out/</span></a>,
or by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at&nbsp;<a
href="https://optout.aboutads.info/"><span style='color:#0563C1'>https://optout.aboutads.info/</span></a>.
You may block all cookies by following the instructions applicable to your
browser at&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-and-delete-cookies"><span
style='color:#0563C1'>https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-and-delete-cookies</span></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, we may provide one-way secured (or “hashed”)
versions of your email address or similar identifying information to certain
third parties to provide more relevant and customized experiences and
advertising to you as you browse the Sites or other third-party websites. This
hashed version of your email address is a text string that uniquely identifies
your email address but which is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that
a third party should be unable to utilize the actual underlying email address
and merely identify you as a unique user across devices, sessions, and browsers
if you provide the same identifying information. If you provide a third party’s
website with the same identifying information and that third party utilizes the
same method of hashing, it is possible that the third party could match
information obtained from us and combine it with information that you provide
to the third-party website. For example, we may use ALC’s advertising services
to provide you with more customized advertising by providing them with a
one-way hashed version of your email address. You can learn more about how they
process information, including information you submit to them directly, and
about how to opt out of their targeted services by visiting&nbsp;<a
